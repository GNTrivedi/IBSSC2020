abstract={The increasing uptake of Distributed Energy Resources and advancement in blockchain technology has led to the growth in interest in the peer-to-peer (P2P) based energy trading. However, there has been a lack of consideration how these trades may affect the network operation, in particular in networks that apply Active Network Management using Last-in-First-out (LIFO) access rules, such as in the UK. This paper presents a novel application of Optimal Power Flow that manages the P2P trading whilst optimising legacy DGs under a LIFO access agreement. Analysis show that under such arrangements, and in combination with autonomous P2P trading, lower priority DGs are vulnerable to excessive curtailment levels. © 2020},

abstract={Across the globe, electricity sectors have seen a relatively large increase in the number of installations of small renewable energy systems, leading to an interest in the potential role of the prosumer. These prosumers (producers and consumers of electricity) could help drive electricity sector transformation, but at present electricity trading is associated with a lack of control and power held by consumers. Peer-to-peer trading schemes between energy consumers are increasingly being reported in the trade press as a new way to empower consumers, especially since the advent of blockchain, an emergent technology that could facilitate the adoption of such schemes. Research to understand how and why electricity trading occurs has received little attention within literature thus far. In this study we investigated the existing elements of electricity trading. A total of 16 structured interviews with domestic consumers, business consumers, domestic prosumers and business prosumers were undertaken. All interviews identified ease of payment as a key theme for electricity trading (although we note that ease may be in tension with sustainability and greater awareness of energy-related environmental impacts). Consumer interviews also identified lack of engagement with the process of receiving energy, and cost, as key themes. Prosumer interviews identified positive associations with power, and personal and business image, as key themes. Therefore, it is recommended that these factors be incorporated into the user interface of blockchain systems, to potentially increase adoption for peer-to-peer trading. © 2020},

abstract={Energy trading in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a fundamental approach to realize Industry 4.0, plays a vital role in satisfying energy demands and optimizing system efficiency. Existing research works utilize a utility company to distribute energy to energy nodes with the help of energy brokers. Afterwards, they apply blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and auditability of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. However, their schemes are constructed on a weak security model and do not consider the cheating attack initiated by energy sellers. Such an attack refers to an energy seller refusing to transfer the negotiated energy to an energy purchaser who already paid money. In this article, we propose FeneChain, a blockchain-based energy trading scheme to supervise and manage the energy trading process toward building a secure energy trading system and improving energy quality for Industry 4.0. Specifically, we leverage anonymous authentication to protect user privacy, and we design a timed-commitments-based mechanism to guarantee the verifiable fairness during energy trading. Moreover, we utilize fine-grained access control for energy trading services. We also build a consortium blockchain among energy brokers to verify and record energy trading transactions. Finally, we formally analyze the security and privacy of FeneChain and evaluate its performance (i.e., computational costs and communication overhead) by implementing a prototype via a local Ethereum test network and Raspberry Pi. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer trading is a next-generation energy management technique that economically benefits proactive consumers (prosumers) transacting their energy as goods and services. At the same time, peer-to-peer energy trading is also expected to help the grid by reducing peak demand, lowering reserve requirements, and curtailing network loss. However, large-scale deployment of peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks poses a number of challenges in modeling transactions in both the virtual and physical layers of the network. As such, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in research on peer-to-peer energy trading techniques. By doing so, we provide an overview of the key features of peer-to-peer trading and its benefits of relevance to the grid and prosumers. Then, we systematically classify the existing research in terms of the challenges that the studies address in the virtual and the physical layers. We then further identify and discuss those technical approaches that have been extensively used to address the challenges in peer-to-peer transactions. Finally, the paper is concluded with potential future research directions. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Local energy generation and peer to peer (P2P) energy trading in the local market can reduce energy consumption cost, emission of harmful gases (as renewable energy sources (RESs) are used to generate energy at user's premises) and increase smart grid resilience. In this paper, to implement a hybrid P2P energy trading market, a blockchain-based solution is proposed. A blockchain-based system is fully decentralized and it allows the market members to interact with each other and trade energy without involving any third party. Smart contracts play a very important role in the blockchain-based energy trading market. They contain all the necessary rules for energy trading. We have proposed three smart contracts to implement the hybrid electricity trading market. The market members interact with main smart contract which requests P2P smart contract and prosumer to grid (P2G) smart contract for further processing. The main objectives of this paper are to propose a model to implement an efficient hybrid energy trading market while reducing cost and peak to average ratio (PAR) of electricity. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={A blockchain-based smart contract has the potential to allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. This paper presents a universal framework for a blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in the retail electricity market. Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Opportunities for microgrids in the electricity market are becoming higher these days due to which consumers are now becoming prosumers. Energy trading in microgrids happens in peer to peer manner where there is a need for third-party involvement. To eliminate this involvement, a technology is needed to make the entire system a decentralized one which is "Blockchain". In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on how blockchain technology can be implemented in the energy sector for mitigating the issues and how peer to peer energy trading happens in the microgrids thereby smart contracts are created for purpose of P2P energy trading using solidity tool. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly increasing in various domains such as disaster management, delivery of goods, surveillance, military, etc. Significant issues in the expansion of UAV-based applications are the security of (IoT to UAV) communication, and the limited flight time of the UAVs and IoT devices considering the limited battery power. Standalone UAVs are not capable of accomplishing several tasks, and therefore swarm of UAVs is being explored. Security issues in the swarm of UAVs do not allow the applications to leverage the full benefits that one can offer. Several recent studies have proposed the use of a distributed network of UAVs to upgrade the level of security in the swarm of UAVs. In this paper, a framework for secure and reliable energy trading among UAVs and charging stations is presented. Advanced blockchain, based on the tangle data structure is used to create a distributed network of UAVs and charging stations. The proposed model allows the UAVs to buy energy from the charging station in exchange for tokens. If the UAV does not have sufficient tokens to buy the energy, then the model allows the UAV to borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens can be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees. A game-theoretic model is used for deciding the buying strategy of energy for UAVs. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed model helps in providing increased utility for the swarm of UAVs and charging stations in a secure and cost-optimal way as compared to the conventional schemes. The results can eventually be applied to IoT devices that constantly need energy to perform under ideal conditions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increase in local energy generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), the concept of decentralized peer-to-peer Local Energy Market (LEM) is becoming popular. In this paper, a blockchain-based LEM is investigated, where consumers and prosumers in a small community trade energy without the need for a third party. In the proposed model, a Home Energy Management (HEM) system and demurrage mechanism are introduced, which allow both the prosumers and consumers to optimize their energy consumption and to minimize electricity costs. This method also allows end-users to shift their load to off-peak hours and to use cheap energy from the LEM. The proposed solution shows how energy consumption and electricity cost are optimized using HEM and demurrage mechanism. It also provides economic benefits at both the community and end-user levels and provides sufficient energy to the LEM. The simulation results show that electricity cost is reduced up to 44.73% and 28.55% when the scheduling algorithm is applied using the Critical Peak Price (CPP) and Real-Time Price (RTP) schemes, respectively. Similarly, 65.15% and 35.09% of costs are reduced when CPP and RTP are applied with demurrage mechanism. Moreover, 51.80% and 44.37% electricity costs reduction is observed when CPP and RTP are used with both demurrage and scheduling algorithm. We also carried out security vulnerability analysis to ensure that our energy trading smart contract is secure and bug-free against the common vulnerabilities and attacks. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Advanced smart grid technologies enable energy prosumers to trade surplus energy from their distributed renewable energy sources with other peer prosumers through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In many previous works, P2P energy trading was facilitated by blockchain technology through blockchain's distributive nature and capacity to run smart contracts. However, the feature that all the data and transactions on a blockchain are visible to all blockchain nodes may significantly threaten the privacy of the parties participating in P2P energy trading. There are many previous works that have attempted to mitigate this problem. However, all these works focused on the anonymity of participants but did not protect the data and transactions. To address this issue, we propose a P2P energy trading system on a blockchain where all bids are encrypted and peer matching is performed on the encrypted bids by a functional encryption-based smart contract. The system guarantees that the information encoded in the encrypted bids is protected, but the peer matching transactions are performed by the nodes in a publicly verifiable manner through smart contracts. We verify the feasibility of the proposed system by implementing a prototype composed of smart meters, a distribution system operator (DSO) server, and private Ethereum blockchain. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={There has been significant recent interest in local electricity trading platforms, and particularly in the application of distributed ledger and blockchain technology for distributed, or peer-to-peer energy trading in local energy communities. Several projects worldwide have demonstrated this concept on a small scale in Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks and microgrids. However, previous work in this area has not sufficiently addressed the potential impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading and other local electricity trading mechanisms on the control, operation and planning of the electricity distribution networks. Accordingly, this paper presents a methodology for the co-simulation of power distribution networks and local peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. The distribution system simulator is interfaced with a peer-to-peer energy trading platform, which employs a blockchain-based distributed double auction trade mechanism. The presented co-simulation approach is demonstrated using a case study of typical European suburban distribution network. It is demonstrated in the paper that this approach can be used to analyse the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on network operational performance. The analysis presented in the paper suggests that a moderate level of peer-to-peer trading does not have significant impacts on network operational performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={After smart grid, Internet of Energy (IoE) has emerged as a popular technology in the energy sector by integrating different forms of energy. IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions. Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions, demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of blockchain in the IoE field.

An energy trading prototype is developed to remotely monitor energy trading activities between prosumers and consumer, using graphical user interface. Experimental results based on a real map of Paisley illustrate that the energy trading system is effective in finding, associating and routing prosumers to consumers, while protecting privacy of entities. Numerical results show a favorable performance of our optimization model in comparison to traditional frameworks. IEEE},

abstract={Nowaday’s energy demand and energy production are increasing. Renewable energy resources will play an important role in managing future production of electricity due to an increase in the development of societies. The centralized energy trading system faces a challenge in terms of fair energy distribution. Centralized existing energy trading system totally relies on a central system or third party, because the third party has many drawbacks in the form of record tampering or record altering. The fair transaction is the main issue in the energy trading sector. When the bitcoin is introduced in the market, the trust of Blockchain technology is increased. We proposed a Blockchain based energy trading system in peer to peer networks. Blockchain technology provides trust, security, and transparency for energy trading. In Blockchain technology, there is no necessary need of the third party in the energy supply sector. In our proposed paper, we facilitate the prosumer who produces renewable energy and sells surplus energy to the consumer. We achieved transparency, accuracy, efficiency in our proposed paper. Using a double auction process, we obtain low energy price and acheived consumer trust in energy trading. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={This chapter presents peer-to-peer energy trading as an emerging case study for the sharing economy. Power systems are undergoing a fundamental transition due to the emergence of distribution network prosumers; proactive-consumers with renewable sources and flexible energy resources that actively manage their consumption, production and storage of energy. Peer-to-peer energy trading has been proposed as a new strategy for integrating prosumers into power system operations. The chapter presents an overview of different business models peer-to-peer energy trading can support, and reviews the mathematical frameworks that have been proposed for designing peer-to-peer and other prosumer-centric energy markets. Case studies are presented, showing how a peer-to-peer energy trading platform can create value for prosumers with a mix of PV generation sources, home battery systems and electric vehicles. Networked matching market theory is used to design a peer-to-peer negotiation mechanism through which the prosumers can agree on a set of mutually beneficial energy transactions none of them wish to renegotiate. Local demand constraints can be enforced by including the prosumers’ supplier in the peer-to-peer market. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Local energy generation and peer to peer (P2P) energy trading in the local market can reduce the energy consumption cost, emission of harmful gases (as renewable energy sources are used to generate energy at user's premises) and increase the smart grid resilience. However, local energy trading with peers can have trust and privacy issues. A centralized system can be used to manage this energy trading but it increases the overall cost of the system and also faces several issues. In this paper, to implement a hybrid P2P energy trading market, a blockchain-based system is proposed. It is fully decentralized and allows the market members to interact with each other and trade energy without involving a third party. Smart contracts play a very important role in the blockchain-based energy trading market. They contain all the necessary rules for energy trading. We have proposed three smart contracts to implement the hybrid electricity trading market. The market members interact with the main smart contract, which requests P2P and prosumer to grid smart contracts for further processing. The main objectives of this paper are to propose a model to implement an efficient hybrid energy trading market while reducing cost and peak to average ratio of electricity. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Energy trading among inter vehicles (V2V) offers an efficient response to most of the problems presented by future electricity supply. V2V is often envisioned as a peer-to-peer (P2P) model of electric mercantilism for electric vehicle (EV) merchandising. With security vulnerability increasing, confidence in secured third parties is declining. Blockchain is becoming increasingly common as it provides a system for privacy conservation and efficient agreement without the need for trusted third parties. However, all operations in such a scheme are restricted by memory, time, computing capital, energy etc. and it is quite obvious that the mechanism for blockchain agreement is not sufficient to address all of them. In this paper, we present an alternative to the blockchain using Hashgraph which is scalable, fast, fault-tolerant and fair. It is efficient, inexpensive, and DoS resistant fulfilling the requirement of V2V energy trading. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Electricity markets are experiencing a shift to a more decentralized structure with small distributed renewable generation sources like residential photovoltaic systems. Simultaneously, information systems have driven the development of a “sharing economy” also in the electricity sector and can enable previously passive consumers to directly trade solar electricity in local communities. However, it is unclear how such peer-to-peer (P2P) markets should be designed to create value for the user. In a framed field experiment, we design and implement Switzerland's first real-world P2P electricity market in a local community. We examine its value proposition for the users and elicit user preferences by enabling the participants to directly influence buy and sell prices for local solar energy. The collected empirical evidence suggests that the P2P exchange is beneficial for users and provides incentives for generation of renewable energy. The results create valuable insights for the design and diffusion of future energy markets. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Increasing demand for electricity necessitates the use of efficient mechanisms for demand response management (DRM) in the existing smart grid (SG) system. In the Industry 4.0 era, the usage of information and communication technologies in the energy industry revolutionized the existing grid called SG, which provides a bi-directional flow of energy and data. To handle the energy demand of the consumers, DRM is crucial. It provides the active participation of consumers in the energy trading system (ETS) between consumers and service providers. The traditional energy trading system (TETS) relies on the centralized system or trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. So, it is essential to equip the SG system with a secure energy trading system (SETS) to provide privacy and security to the consumer's data. In this direction, one of the emerging technology, called blockchain, can handle the issue as mentioned above, which is a chain of decentralized and distributed transaction ledger that is retained and maintained by each user. It performs peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transactions among different consumers, such as individual houses, using smart contracts, and without a central control body. In a decentralized system, each consumer has its energy storage locally generated using renewable energy resources (RES). In this article, SETS, a blockchain-based decentralized ETS framework, is proposed for storing and processing the data generated from smart meters (SMs). In SETS, miner node is designated to validate the requests of energy requirements, dynamic pricing, and time of stay. Then, an energy transaction execution approach is designed for SETS. The evaluation results obtained show that SETS outperforms the TETS in terms of computation time and communication costs. IEEE},

abstract={Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Prosumer concept and digitilization offer the exciting potential of microgrid transactive energy systems at distribution level for reducing transmission losses, decreasing electric infrastructure expenditure, improving reliability, enhancing local energy use, and minimizing customers' electricity bills.

Hence, this paper discusses transactive energy concept and proposes seven functional layers architecture for designing transactive energy system. The proposed architecture is compared with practical case study of Brooklyn microgrid. Moreover, this paper reviews the existing architectures and explains the widely known distributed ledger technologies (blockchain, directed acyclic graph, hashgraph, holochain, and tempo) alongwith their advantages and challenges. The local energy market concept is presented and critically analyzed for energy trade within a transactive energy system. This paper also reviews the potential and challenges of peer-to-peer and community-based energy markets.

abstract={Under pressures to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is an ongoing transition of energy decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We found that in particular consumers demanded for secure energy supply, while prosumers wanted to keep control of their energy production. Prosumers expressed their interest in detailed consumption and sales information, while consumers were interested in the legal matters of the contract and the energy source.

abstract={Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be highly efficient in various applications like hidden area exploration, delivery, or surveillance and can enhance the quality of experience (QoE) for end-users. However, the number of drone-based applications are not very high due to the constrained flight time. The weights of the drones need to be kept less, and intuitively they cannot be loaded with big batteries. Frequent recharging and battery replacement processes limit the appropriate use of drones in most applications. A peer-to-peer distributed network of drones and charging stations is a highly promising solution to empower drones to be used in multiple applications by increasing their flight time. The charging stations are limited, and therefore, an adequate, fair, and cost-optimal scheduling algorithm is required to serve the most needed drone first. The proposed model allows the drones to enter into the network and request for a charging time slot from the station. The stations are also the part of the same network, this work proposes a scheduling algorithm for drones who compete for charging slots with constraints of optimizing criticality and task deadline. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the energy trading between the drones and charging station in a cost-optimal manner. Numerical results based on simulations show that the proposed model provides a better price for the drones to get charged and better revenue for the charging stations simultaneously. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Energy market trading systems are undergoing rapid transformation due to an increasing demand for renewable energy sources to be integrated into the power grid, coupled with the dynamic and evolving needs of future energy customers. In the current energy trading system, which is based on mega power generation, energy is traded by insecure means of communication based on mutual trust. In addition, electricity from both renewable and non-renewable sources is mixed in the grid, impeding customers' ability to definitively track the source of energy dispatched to their premises. Although blockchain technology has been studied for energy trading on a peer-to-peer microgrid trading, to our knowledge none of the previous work focused on using blockchain for trading energy in a national wholesale energy market in macrogrid. In this paper, we address security architectures required of the energy market trading system in an Australian context, we propose a cryptocurrency token-based structure and a smart contract that provides data confidentiality that verifies and audits transactional records. The proposed trading system architecture not only enhances overall system security but provides additional capabilities in the operation of the scheme so that sources of energy dispatched to customer premises are known. The energy market trading system we propose also presents higher security compared to existing trading systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the efficacious and continual development in the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with the power grid, the power system is metamorphosing towards a dynamic, decentralized and distributed energy paradigm. DERs are classified as wind turbine generators, rooftop solar PV plants, energy storage devices, and electric vehicles that are usually owned and operated by the end-users of a distribution network. A smart grid framework which incentivizes the active involvement of such end-user based DERs into the grid is the ideal requirement to embrace this transition. Since the end-users not only consume but also generate power as well, for such 'Prosumers', Peer to Peer (P2P) trading will provide a market place for localized energy trading between peers, enabling sustainability and ensuring locally balanced distributed energy within the community. This paper proposes an innovative market mechanism and a pricing strategy for the smart grid - P2P Trading, which allows for each peer of the network to participate in energy trading with each other and with the grid. The paper also shows the potential of P2P trading in reducing consumer costs, and by exploring opportunities for earning revenue for the prosumers from surplus energy. The import and export profiles of a group of consumers of an actual distribution utility have been used for this study. After observing the power profiles of the consumers, the best suitable period for P2P trading has been identified and a possible pricing strategy has been discussed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of blockchain technology and the increasing penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems have presented a new opportunity for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In such transactive markets, communities may enjoy cheaper electricity prices while supporting locally produced green energy. However, there exists a considerable knowledge gap between market mechanisms and energy exchanges. Challenges arise in the auction process to ensure individual rationality, incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic efficiency. This paper offers insights for building the foundation of a P2P energy trading market and presents a comparative analysis of auction mechanisms and bidding strategies for P2P solar electricity exchanges in terms of market demand and supply metrics. Auction mechanisms considered in this paper are Discriminatory and Uniform k-Double Auction (k-DA). Impacts of different bidding strategies, including game theoretic approaches, on the economic efficiencies of the P2P transactive energy market are also studied.

The transaction rules are formulated in the form of smart contract, applying the blockchain technology to clearly define the rights and obligations of prosumers.

abstract={With a spectacular boom in blockchain technologies at various verticals and with the increase in renewable energy penetration, these could solve one of the major issues in Power Systems-Energy Demand Management by the utilities. Blockchain being a distributed architecture, it could fit into the deregulated energy market to enable energy trading in a self sustainable energy community and manage the power demands among the community members. As proof of concept, the blockchain technology is introduced in a smart community where consumers take part in energy trading among themselves as well as with the utility. In this paper, three use cases for P2P energy trading in a private blockchain network is discussed. The blockchain architecture is developed using the Hyperledger framework and the smart contracts are defined in the chaincode.

abstract={With the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet of Things, the smart grid is being projected as a solution for the challenges regarding electricity supply in the future. However, security and privacy issues in the consumption and trading of electricity data pose serious challenges in the adoption of the smart grid. To address these challenges, blockchain technology is being researched for applicability in the smart grid. In this paper, important application areas of blockchain in the smart grid are discussed. One use case of each area is discussed in detail, suggesting a suitable blockchain architecture, a sample block structure and the potential blockchain technicalities employed in it. The blockchain can be used for peer-to-peer energy trading, where a credit-based payment scheme can enhance the energy trading process. Efficient data aggregation schemes based on the blockchain technology can be used to overcome the challenges related to privacy and security in the grid. Energy distribution systems can also use blockchain to remotely control energy flow to a particular area by monitoring the usage statistics of that area. Further, blockchain-based frameworks can also help in the diagnosis and maintenance of smart grid equipment. We also discuss several commercial implementations of blockchain in the smart grid. Finally, various challenges to be addressed for integrating these two technologies are discussed. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the emerging technology for distributed generation and urge of improving quality of service of power supply for energy users, more and more Microgrids (MGs) are integrated into the distributed networks to serve the energy users. These Microgrids are gradually formulating a Multi-Microgrid System (MMGS, Multi-Microgrid System), which will play an important role for the future energy supply. Building a centralized control center not only increases the expense of investment, but also brings the issues of maintaining fairness among energy users. To address these problems, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer method for energy trading of MMGS, based on the idea of decentralized trading. An auction-based trading mechanism suitable for peer-to-peer energy trading is proposed first. For this mechanism, the MGs firstly declare their energy buying bids or selling quotations. Then, the market-clearing price is determined by using a unified weight clearing algorithm in a decentralized manner. By applying the edge technology of Blockchain, the implementation of the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading method, including the architecture, procedures, security check, etc., is also discussed. The proposed Blockchain-based energy trading platform can realize the decentralized and autonomous energy trading of MGs within an MMGS. A case study with an MMGS with 10 MG units is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a peer to peer (P2P), blockchain based energy trading market platform for residential communities with the objective of reducing overall community peak demand and household electricity bills. Smart homes within the community place energy bids for its available distributed energy resources (DERs) for each discrete trading period during a day, and a double auction mechanism is used to clear the market and compute the market clearing price (MCP). The marketplace is implemented on a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, where bids are stored to the immutable ledger and smart contracts are used to implement the MCP calculation and award service contracts to all winning bids. Utilizing the blockchain obviates the need for a trusted, centralized auctioneer, and eliminates vulnerability to a single point of failure. Simulation results show that the platform enables a community peak demand reduction of 46%, as well as a weekly savings of 6%. The platform is also tested at a real-world Canadian microgrid using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, to show the end to end connectivity of smart home DERs to the platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading could help address grid management challenges in a decentralizing electricity system, as well as provide other social and environmental benefits. Many existing and proposed trading schemes are enabled by blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) relying on cryptographic proof of ownership rather than human intermediaries to establish energy transactions. This study used an online survey experiment (n = 2064) to investigate how consumer demand for blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer energy trading schemes in the United Kingdom varies depending on how the consumer proposition is designed and communicated. The analysis provides some evidence of a preference for schemes offering to meet a higher proportion of participants' energy needs and for those operating at the city/region (as compared to national or neighbourhood) level. People were more likely to say they would participate when the scheme was framed as being run by their local council, followed by an energy supplier, community energy organization, and social media company. Anonymity was the most valued DLT characteristic and mentioning blockchain's association with Bitcoin led to a substantial decrease in intended uptake. We highlight a range of important questions and implications suggested by these findings for the introduction and operation of P2P trading schemes. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={We consider blockchain architectures for P2P energy trading of surpluses and demands between prosumers and consumers in the neighborhood without any intermediaries. We identify key elements comprising the P2P energy trading platform based on blockchain. The software architecture of our energy trading platform is provided with example codes. We build smart contracts on Ethereum for determination of trading price as well as matching between prosumers and consumers in such a way to balance the surpluses and the demands. At the start of each trading period, the prosumers and consumers send their respective amounts of surplus or demand. And the smart contract for price determination automatically evaluates the price in a predetermined way to balance surplus and demand within the neighborhood. Another smart contract performs matching between prosumers and consumers using this price. Authenticated and private messaging called 'whisper' is employed for prosumers and DSO(Distributed System Operator)s to notify injection of surplus energy to the DSO and verify the ownership of the injected energy. Each participant interacts with Ethereum virtual machine through web server built with Node.js, Web3.js and Geth. We build a small experimental setup with 4 Raspberry-Pis in a private Ethereum network to provide proof-of-concept for our blockchain based P2P trading architecture between neighbors. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Climate change enforces the integration of distributed renewable energy sources and development of carbon price scheme. Whilst the energy is traded among distributed prosumers, the carbon responsibilities and corresponding allowances trading need to be transferred from large-scale energy suppliers to prosumers. During this transformation, the issues of energy imbalance, carbon reduction imbalance, and residential privacy leakage in centralised trading market present serious challenges. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralised blockchain-based peer-to-peer trading scheme coupling energy and carbon markets. We implement pay-to-public-key-hash with multiple signatures as a transaction standard to realise a more secure transaction and reduced storage burden of senders. A script is hashed during the wallet address generation for each new transaction to protect residential privacy. A novel carbon accounting method and corresponding incentive mechanism for carbon reduction are designed to evaluate emission behaviours of distributed prosumers. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme leads a reduced costs and carbon emissions compared to centralised trading systems and existing blockchain-based trading schemes. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain technology is ready to disrupt nearly every industry and business model, and the energy sector is no exception. Energy businesses across the world have already started exploring the use of blockchain technology in large-scale energy trading systems, peer-to-peer energy trading, project financing, supply chain tracking, and asset management among other applications. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) recently started revolutionizing the energy landscape, and now blockchain technology is providing an additional opportunity to make the energy system more intelligent, efficient, transparent, and secure in the longer term. The idea of this paper is to examine more closely the use of blockchain technology for its possible application in the energy efficiency industry and to determine how it could make energy efficiency markets more secure and transparent in the longer term. This paper examines in detail the key benefits and implications of using blockchain in the energy efficiency sector through the presentation and discussion of two case studies as possible blockchain applications—(i) the UK Energy Company Obligation scheme and (ii) the Italian White Certificate Scheme. We have presented how the key issues around trading energy efficiency savings—correctly estimating the savings, data transparency among stakeholders, and inefficient administrative processes—can be solved through the application of a blockchain-based smart contract system. Finally, this paper presents an implementation of a smart contract for trading of energy-saving certificates achieved via execution of smart contract transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The power grid is rapidly transforming, and while recent grid innovations increased the utilization of advanced control methods, the next-generation grid demands technologies that enable the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) - and consumers that both seamlessly buy and sell electricity. This paper develops an optimization model and blockchain-based architecture to manage the operation of crowdsourced energy systems (CESs), with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading transactions (ETTs). An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of ETT and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain technology is being developed rapidly in recent years. It has been applied to stock trading, supply chain auditing, crowd-funding, energy trading, and Internet-of-Things. Specifically, in Internet-of-Things applications, how the data is transmitted before reaching a blockchain platform reliably is a challenging issue. In this paper, we focus on an energy trading scenario with Internet-of-Things blockchain applications for energy trading. In this scenario, energy generated from renewable sources can be traded in a peer-To-peer manner among micro-grids. This requires a high level of data communication reliability. Blockchain is adopted as an effective decentralized transaction management solution. In particular, we propose a proof-of-concept for reliable data transmission from smart meters to the blockchain based on Sigfox technology and the Ethereum. To enhance reliability, we configure the base station antenna as a block-based mode and propose a physical data layer for wireless communication. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed wireless communication system for the blockchain. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Regional energy trading mainly provides sales and purchase transaction contracts through a centralized trading service platform, and cooperates with power grid for power supply and transportation. There are problems in it such as high service cost, low transaction efficiency, and lack of user privacy. Based on analysis of the characteristics of regional energy trading, this paper builds a basic application structure of regional energy trading based on blockchain smart contract, distributed accounting, and peer-to-peer trading. This paper proposes a regional energy trading model based on smart contracts. The prosumer within the region can send transaction requests through blockchain network, obtain clearing price through two-way auction pricing mechanism, respond to the transaction request, and trigger state machine to execute the contract, thus completing the transaction. Taking the regional energy trading of multiple producers and consumers in the park as an example, the regional energy trading process based on smart contracts is given. This paper presents a regional energy trading process based on smart contracts, using a blockchain network such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric to build an experimental environment to simulate regional energy transactions involving multiple energy prosumer, verifying feasibility of above method. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={The peer-to-peer energy trading has been achieved among nodes in industrial Internet of Things. To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the reform of electricity market, micro-grid or users with distributed generation are allowed to participate in electricity’ market transactions as the main power sellers. However, under the existing conditions, energy transaction is faced with the problem of lack of trust and centralization. Blockchain technology, as a new distributed encryption method, is of great significance to realize fair, point-to-point, real-time and untrusted energy trading among users. Firstly, this paper introduces the existing blockchain energy trading project, and analyzes and the Baas platform available to developers. Then the P2P energy transaction network and transaction algorithm using blockchain technology are designed, and the application process of the blockchain Baas platform is analyzed. Finally, the operation examples of three distributed PV users in a park are used to illustrate the decentralization, transparency and had to falsify of the microgrid energy transaction under the blockchain technology, and to promote the safe and efficient operation of the microgrid and the effectiveness of the greatest social benefits. © 2019, State Power Economic Research Institute.

abstract={The pressure of climate change and the need to adopt renewable energy sources (RES) have led to an increased development of microgrid technologies. Their modularizable and scalable nature presents opportunities for the development of a new class of players in the power system, i.e. prosumers. The large-scale integration of RES creates acute challenges to the existing power systems. In this context, a reliable and secured balance between energy generation and consumption is highly required. To overcome these problems at microgrid level, a key role is played by the peer-to-peer energy trading using the blockchain concept. In this paper, we present an efficient approach that can be useful for energy trading using blockchain from both active participants (prosumers and consumers). The proposed approach meets the new Romanian regulation regarding prosumers. The results of the study emphasize that the proposed methodology could lead to an efficient balance between local supply and demand with benefits to the participants. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Micro and decentralized generation of electrical power is an emerging trend in the power industry. Blockchain technology allows decentralized and instant monetary and contractual transactions to occur over peer to peer private and public networks by satisfying cyber security concerns. Both changes have the potential to enable paradigm shift in the field of energy in the coming years. Decentralization in the energy business makes this sector a good playground for blockchain technology. As of now, energy applications of blockchain technology are in conceptual and early stage prototyping levels. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of P2P energy trading related blockchain technology applications and proposes a comprehensive multi-layer energy model architecture for the peer to peer (P2P) energy trading implementations where the use of blockchain technology is integrated. P2P energy trading allows consumers to become prosumers of electricity in a more efficient, trustable, and profitable way.

abstract={The proliferation of renewable energy systems and high-capacity batteries has enabled customers to trade their excess energy on the market in a peer-to-peer manner through the smart grid. At the same time, electric vehicles (EVs) are enjoying widespread acceptance, leading to a higher demand for charging stations. In this paper, we propose a system where energy traders and EV owners collectively work to satisfy the energy demands of EVs. Specifically, energy traders make bids to EV owners who, in turn, reserve their preferred charging station for a specific period of time. To protect the privacy of EV owners, we also introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link individual owners to specific charging locations. Finally, to guarantee the security and transparency of the entire system, we store all transactions on a consortium blockchain that is managed by the energy traders and the financial institutions that support the anonymous payment system. Our experimental results indicate that the overhead of the cryptographic operations involved in the major transactions is low, in terms of both computational and communication cost. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart grid (SG) provides a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism wherein the electric vehicles (EVs) can trade for energy with their peers using the information and communication technologies. However, the dependence on third party for coordinating the energy trading decisions leads to a bottleneck for any distributed environment. Therefore, blockchain technology can provide a privacy-preserving and effective consensus mechanism without the control of trusted third party. Although blockchain provides inherent secure framework for transactional process, but the this security is because of computational complexity enforced. In SG environment, the conventional blockchain process could not be employed due to limited computational resources with EVs, which makes it difficult to solve the tough computational puzzles to validate the transactions. On the other hand, any compromise on the computation difficulty makes it more vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, in this paper, SmartChain: a blockchain inspired smart and scalable ledger framework which does not require much computational complexity is designed for secure peer-to-peer energy trading in SG ecosystem. The proposed framework is evaluated using the parameters such as execution and validation time. The results obtained depict the superiority of SmartChain in contrast to the conventional blockchain process. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Proliferation of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) changed power system operation drastically. They introduced generation at distribution level, which was unprecedented. Also, bidirectional power flow created more optimization opportunities such as Demand Side Management (DSM) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) support. These schemes allow for efficient use of grid infrastructure, storage devices and DERs. In order to plan the operation and calculate bills, it is imperative to keep a record of these transactions. When some sort of trading occurs between multiple parties, trust is a major concern. Traditionally, a third part trusted by all keeps the record of transactions. Using blockchain technology for energy trading eliminates the role of trusted third party. This paper discusses the feasibility and benefits of implementing blockchain for smartgrids. It also develops an Ethereum-based implementation of blockchain technology for energy trading. Results are shown for a case where energy transactions are undertaken between Distribution System Operator (DSO) and smart meters of individual houses. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With special emphasis being put upon renewable sources of energy day-by-day, there is a growing demand for this new technology to be integrated into the existing framework. To be widely accepted and made sustainable, such a technology should be profitable for all participating entities; giving them incentive enough to continue using it. What remains to be answered is the question of how that will be done. We break down the traditional power grid into smaller clusters, called microgrid and discuss its properties as potential candidates for implementing Blockchain powered energy trading mechanisms. Blockchain enabled technology is chosen as it brings with it, a degree of security, transparency and automation; and cuts out the established monopoly with the decentralized network and peer-to-peer trading. Two such working algorithms are reviewed for their implementation into the microgrid. One algorithm works on an auction model while another is a calculative data-dependent model but both the models function using smart contracts. Pre-existing projects in this field and their implementation around the world are reviewed by us in the later section of the paper. We conclude this paper by encapsulating the deployment considerations and limitations of employing Blockchain technology in a microgrid. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Integration of renewables and energy storage, leading to rise of prosumers, has created localized bidirectional flows. As the result, the utility demand has decreased and traditional centralized controller can no longer realize the optimal performance of ever growing distribution systems. To achieve scalable control, exploiting the potential of smart loads and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) controllability, a framework for decentralized Peer-To-Peer (P2P) energy management has been developed to manage localized micro-energy markets. Such decentralized management approach could, in theory, sustain diverse prosumer and utility business models. We have been developing an autonomous decentralized management solution that maximizes the benefit of prosumers while protecting utility assets. This P2P energy trading market leverages Blockchain technology and its Smart Contract framework.

abstract={Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain, are gaining increasing attention in the energy sector, where they can be used to support Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. Several proof-of-concept and pilot projects are running all over the world to test this specific use case. However, despite much work addressing the technical and regulatory aspects related to DLT for P2P energy trading, our understanding of the human aspects affecting the adoption of these systems and technologies is still minimal. The development of a decentralized energy market poses interesting challenges to the HCI community and raises important questions that need to be answered: do people trust a system which is, by definition, trust-free? How do they perceive P2P energy trading? What are their needs and motivations for engaging in energy trading? Moreover, are people willing to use cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange for energy? And, to what extent is full-automation desirable? To shed light on these and related questions, we developed and tested PowerShare, a decentralized, P2P energy trading platform. In this paper, we report on our findings from interviews with nine families that have used PowerShare for a month. Motivated by our empirical findings we conclude by highlighting guidelines for designing P2P energy trading platforms and elaborate directions for further research. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The gradual opening of the power-sales-side market liberalization and the development of distributed energy resources ( DER) have brought opportunities and challenges to the operation of the micro-grid. Peer to peer (P2P) energy trading can optimize the energy structure, give full play to the advantages of distributed generation, and improve the efficiency of energy systems. This paper takes the P2P energy trading system of micro-grids as the research object. Considering China's existing power reform policies, three key issues need to be resolved at the steady-state level; how to optimize the transmission of distributed energy flow and how to establish an efficient communication system, and how to solve the problem of user payment involved by P2P energy trading process. From the perspective of energy flow, information flow and money flow, the solution to the correlation analysis of the P2P trading system in the micro-grid is described. From the engineering point of view, the P2P energy trading process in the micro-grid under the new situation is analyzed. The key equipment and core software platforms have provided some suggestions for promoting the marketization and landing of distributed power generation in China. © 2019 State Power Economic Research Institute.

abstract={Across the world, the organisation and operation of the electricity markets is quickly changing, moving towards decentralised, distributed, renewables-based generation with real-time data exchange-based solutions. In order to support this change, blockchain-based distributed ledgers have been proposed for implementation of peer-to-peer energy trading platform. However, blockchain solutions suffer from scalability problems as well as from delays in transaction confirmation. This paper explores the feasibility of using IOTA&#x2019;s DAG-based block-free distributed ledger for implementation of energy trading platforms. Our agent-based simulation research demonstrates that an IOTA-like DAG-based solution could overcome the constraints that blockchains face in the energy market. However, to be usable for peer-to-peer energy trading, even DAG-based platforms need to consider specificities of energy trading markets (such as structured trading periods and assured confirmation of transactions for every completed period). &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer energy trading and next generation local energy market mechanisms are expected to provide new use cases and opportunities within the future sharing economy landscape. To this anticipation, we propose alternative incentive mechanisms as energy policy instruments that can be used by policy makers for directly supporting local energy producers, and hence indirectly the consumers, at current local energy markets using capabilities provided by contemporary distributed ledger technology. Under such peer-to-peer local market setting, we first detail market pricing and relevant market parameters thoroughly, and then we discuss fair incentive distribution to local producers in detail, by means of two distinct incentive systems what we call as the fixed stipend and the decaying stipend incentive mechanisms, respectively. We provide an analysis of market pricing and market parameters under German power market conditions, and an illustration of proposed support instruments with resorting to three scenarios experimented on a local energy market test bed that is equipped with realistic energy generation and consumption profiles for its participants. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain is regarded as a revolutionary technology, which is widely used in different fields all over world，especially for the application in energy field. With the development of distributed generation, there's a greater opportunity for distributed generation trading. In the near future, everyone may be able to sell their surplus electricity generated by their rooftop photovoltaic. It can be determined that blockchain can increase the trust between transactors. Blockchain can provide convenience for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In addition, blockchain can be used in other energy fields such as IOT, shared EV charging pile and etc. Because of the above advantages, many countries in the world are developing energy blockchain and have built some applied engineering programs. Some representative projects in US are introduced in this paper, and advanced technologies adopted in these existing projects are also analyzed.

abstract={The rapid transition of energy markets from centralized to distributed models entails several challenges, such as the management of bi-directional energy flows and complex transactions, increased volatility, exponential growth of the number of players and of data volume, legacy issues for players, cyber security and data privacy. Direct peer-to-peer trading based on the blockchain technology applied to the virtual power plant concept can create a direct connection between suppliers and consumers of energy and represents a viable solution to meet these challenges. Blockchain can be defined as an immutable distributed ledger that verifies and records, in a safe and secure way, peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. In recent years, blockchain is acquiring an increasing relevance, since it guarantees transparency for every transaction, creates trust through a shared database, and increases the efficiency of the transactions. Furthermore, blockchain reduces the number of third-party intermediaries, simplifies market processes and architectures, and increases operational efficiency. Blockchain technology has an extensive range of use that can disrupt the energy sector. For instance, it has the potential to speed-up an open energy market also for small customers, where electricity prices come from the balance of demand and supply like other tradable commodities. Peer-to-peer energy trading platforms also open-up the possibility to distinguish where energy is coming from (i.e., renewables, coal, oil, and gas), which allows environmentally conscious consumers to choose renewable energy. The aim of this work is to investigate how blockchain can transform the current energy market in order to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to understand the related potentials and risks for prosumers and grid operators. Moreover, managerial insights will be provided for supporting stakeholders and regulators in the management of the future energy market enabled by the blockchain. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

abstract={Being a decentralized system makes Blockchain a suitable technology solution in many cases. The Smart Energy domain has the potential to benefit from the use of Blockchain, by improving data and transaction management, through applications such as peer-to-peer energy trading, grid enhancement, and electric vehicle support. Many researchers have proposed models and prototypes of blockchain-based applications, which are expected to improve the performance of smart energy systems. In this report, a qualitative literature review was performed to look into a sample of these application proposals and to try to identify the impacts of blockchain technology in Smart Energy. This resulted in the discovery of both positive and negative factors. The beneficial factors include increased security, improved data privacy, data transparency and immutability, removal of third-party control and trust, ubiquitous solution, and greater data accessibility. The list of challenges includes limited scalability and speed, off-chain support requirement, high establishment and maintenance cost, and requiring further practical tests. One of the interesting findings is that the impact of Blockchain technology as to whether it may increase or decrease transaction costs is still unclear. Finally, the paper recommends that a future study may focus on economic feasibility and transaction costs, and ascertain which Smart Energy cases and application designs are more appropriate for Blockchain technology. © 2019 National Taipei University.

The low feed-in tariff offered by the electricity retailer is another incentive to trade the energy within the project boundaries or neighbouring precincts using the Blockchain peer to peer energy trading. This study develops an energy system model for the RENeW Nexus project as part of smart city development at stage one in the City of Fremantle for a small community (Lot 1819) comprising 36 townhouses and 50 apartments. The system was developed to simulate the optimal Power to Gas (P2G) system for excess renewable energy storage in combination with shared strata battery towards an energy self-sufficiency system. The rooftop area of the townhouses in the developed precinct has been used to generate excess renewable energy from solar photovoltaic (PV) to compensate for less area available on the rooftops of the multi-story apartment’s buildings in the presence of a large-scale centralised strata battery. The peer to peer energy trading takes place using Blockchain technology to achieve the energy self-sufficiency goal. The study also identifies the techno-economic viability of P2G system over the large-scale energy storage systems. The model simulation demonstrated that the initial cost of the P2G system is comparably less than the current conventional battery systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The rise of distributed energy generation technologies along with grid constraints, and conventional non-consumer centric business models, is leading many to explore alternative configurations of the energy system. Particularly popular are peer-to-peer energy trading models in which the role of the energy company is replaced with a trustless transaction layer based on a public blockchain. However, to ensure stable operation of microgrids, an energy company is required to constantly balance supply and demand. In this paper, we study the problem that arises from the conflicting goals of prosumers (to make money) and network operators (to keep the network stable) that have to co-exist in future energy systems. We show that prosumers can play large-scale synchronization games to benefit from the system. If they synchronize their actions to artificially increase energy demand on the market, the resulting power peaks will force the microgrid operator to use backup generation capacities and, as a consequence, contribute to the increased profit margins for prosumers. We study synchronization games from a game-theoretical point of view and argue that even non-cooperative selfish prosumers can learn to play synchronization games independently and enforce undesired outcomes for consumers and the grid. We build a simple model where prosumers independently run Q-learning algorithms to learn their most profitable strategies and show that synchronization games constitute a Nash equilibrium. We discuss implications of our findings and argue the necessity of appropriate mechanism design for stable microgrid operation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Inspired by the online peer-to-peer (P2P) goods trading that has become increasingly popular in the recent years, in this paper we propose a decentralized P2P electricity marketing mechanism for a microgrid (MG) consisting of networked prosumer (consumers with distributed generation capability) clusters by incorporating Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts (SC). Our proposed electricity marketing mechanism is a two-level hierarchical one: In the upper level, the aggregators (AGGs) cooperate with each other and in the lower level, the local PRs maximize their financial profits via P2P energy trading. This mechanisms potentially results in price of anarchy instances in which the targets of the two level players will be contradictory. To address this issue, we assume that there exists a single universal cost function for both levels of the game. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed P2P electricity marketing mechanism in maximizing the self-sufficiency of the microgrid and minimizing the side effects of the discriminatory pricing. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Power and energy systems are undergoing unprecedented change driven by many factors like global warming, digitalization, new sorts of renewable energy sources (RESs). Many countries incentivize the installation of RESs with subsidies and programs like a high rate of feed-in tariffs. However, these promotions are not sustainable. Some countries started to decrease the feed-in tariffs due to the cost of RESs are in decline. Since they want to reduce the volatility risk of small-scale RESs, they also don't give capacity for unlicensed plants. Renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) emerge as an alternative to encourage the installation of unlicensed RESs. They can be defined as prosumers in the system. Also, a peer to peer energy trading between cooperatives within the local community might increase the profit of cooperative in the same region. Because of this, the peer to peer business model approach is proposed in this study. The smart contract by using blockchain technology is used in this proposed approach due to making transactions faster, and to provide a dynamic market and blockchain is used to make transactions data secure. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Power systems world-wide are currently undergoing unprecedented change as the global energy mix transitions from primarily fossil-fuel based synchronous generation towards utility-scale and distributed renewable energy generation. This paper explores the rationale for the pursuit of alternative network architectures to facilitate the transition towards high penetration levels of renewable energies. Furthermore, the emerging research field of transactive energy markets and their potential for energy price reductions is presented. The paper examines the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised transactive energy market as a mechanism for permitting higher levels of distributed generation and storage and for energy price reductions, with the Australian energy market used as a case study. The primary contributions of this paper are the development of a decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy market (TEM) and the derivation of an autonomous agent algorithm capable of monitoring the internal states of agents to place bids and offers to the market accordingly. This paper (part 1 of 2) investigates the behaviour of the TEM and agent algorithm when applied to an isolated intergrid architecture level. The simulation results contained here-within demonstrate that the decentralised TEM and distributed agent algorithm operate in accordance with the desired fundamental principles of economics (supply vs demand), with the potential for significant retail energy price reductions and higher levels of renewable energies. © 2018 IEEE.},

Multidimensional willingness, including time pressure and counter behavior for mimicking the personalized behaviors of microgrids, was taken into account in the design of the bidding strategy. Under a parallel trading framework based on a blockchain, the proposed multidimensional willingness bidding strategy turns out to be able to make rational decisions with sufficient flexibility in the bidding process.

abstract={Deployment of distributed generation technologies, especially solar photovoltaic, have turned regular consumers into active contributors to the local supply of electricity. This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the specific rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As different local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system configurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and flexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31% for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery's flexibility in balancing supply-demand operations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As more and more distributed renewable energy resources are integrated to the grid, the traditional consumers have become the prosumers who can sell back their surplus energy to the others who are in energy shortage. This peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction framework benefits the end users, financially and in term of energy security; and the network operators, in term of flexibility in DRES management, peak load shifting and regulation of voltage/frequency. Environmentally, P2P energy transaction also helps to reduce carbon footprint, reduces DRES payback period and incentivizes the installation of DRES. The current centralized market model is no longer suitable and it is therefore necessary to develop an adapted decentralized architecture for the advanced P2P energy transaction framework intra/inter-micro grid.

abstract={In industrial Internet of things (IIoT), peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading ubiquitously takes place in various scenarios, e.g., microgrids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid networks. However, there are common security and privacy challenges caused by untrusted and nontransparent energy markets in these scenarios. To address the security challenges, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to propose a secure energy trading system named energy blockchain. This energy blockchain can be widely used in general scenarios of P2P energy trading getting rid of a trusted intermediary. Besides, to reduce the transaction limitation resulted from transaction confirmation delays on the energy blockchain, we propose a credit-based payment scheme to support fast and frequent energy trading. An optimal pricing strategy using Stackelberg game for credit-based loans is also proposed. Security analysis and numerical results based on a real dataset illustrate that the proposed energy blockchain and credit-based payment scheme are secure and efficient in IIoT. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the expansion of small scale distributed energy resources such as solar rooftop and PEVs, decentralized energy trading is expected to be one of the most important components of next generation power systems. Decentralized peer-To-peer energy exchange systems are believed to be a promising solution not only to solve the scalability and mobility problems in the existing system but also to create a competitive market that can benefit small scale prosumers and consumers. However, such systems need to be equipped with the necessary security, privacy and payment transaction mechanisms to be efficient and trusted. In this paper, we propose a decentralized energy exchange system based on Blockchains. Blockchains is a technology that supports secure transactions between participating entities in a decentralized peer-To-peer network. The proposed system allows for energy exchange between prosumers using a form of smart electronic contracts which are based on Blockchains. © 2018 IEEE.},

It took investigative reporters almost two years to learn that Nakamoto was never any one person, but the collective moniker of several designers. Wilson, by contrast, lives a very real life in individual form. In 2001, he discovered the first block chain, laying the foundation for Bitcoin and every subsequent manifestation of Blockchain technology. In conversation with British journalist, Jack Aldane, Wilson discusses his childhood attraction to technology, the path which led him to discover Blockchain as a tool for fraud prevention, his thoughts about the power and limits of technology to engender transparency and trust in the 21st century, and whether it matters to him that he is credited as the inventor of the Blockchain. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Due to the expansion of distributed renewable energy resources, peer to peer energy trading (P2P DET) is expected to be one of the key elements of next generation power systems. P2P DET can provide various benefits such as creating a competitive energy market, reducing power outages, increasing overall efficiency of power systems and supplementing alternative sources of energy according to user preferences. Because of these promising advantages, P2P DET has attracted the attention of several researchers. Current research related to P2P DET include demand response optimization, power routing, network communication, security and privacy. This paper presents a review of the main research topics revolving around P2P DET. Particularly, we present a comprehensive survey of existing demand response optimization models, power routing devices and power routing algorithms. We also identify some key challenges faced in realizing P2P DET. Furthermore, we discuss state of the art enabling technologies such as Energy Internet, Blockchain and Software Defined Networking (SDN) and we provide insights into future research directions. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Generation from distributed renewable energy sources is constantly increasing. Due to its volatility, the integration of this non-controllable generation poses severe challenges to the current energy system. Thus, ensuring a reliable balance of energy generation and consumption becomes increasingly demanding. In our approach to tackle these challenges, we suggest that consumers and prosumers can trade self-produced energy in a peer-to-peer fashion on microgrid energy markets. Thus, consumers and prosumers can keep profits from energy trading within their community. This provides incentives for investments in renewable generation plants and for locally balancing supply and demand. Hence, both financial as well as socio-economic incentives for the integration and expansion of locally produced renewable energy are provided. The efficient operation of these microgrid energy markets requires innovative information systems for integrating the market participants in a user-friendly and comprehensive way. To this end, we present the concept of a blockchain-based microgrid energy market without the need for central intermediaries. We derive seven market components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Then, we evaluate the Brooklyn Microgrid project as a case study of such a market according to the required components. We show that the Brooklyn Microgrid fully satisfies three and partially fulfills an additional three of the seven components. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that blockchains are an eligible technology to operate decentralized microgrid energy markets. However, current regulation does not allow to run local peer-to-peer energy markets in most countries and, hence, the seventh component cannot be satisfied yet. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increasing uptake of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems and the rapid advance of technology have established new scenarios in the operation of low-voltage networks. In particular, recent trends in cryptocurrencies and blockchain have led to a proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading schemes, which allow the exchange of energy between the neighbors without any intervention of a conventional intermediary in the transactions. Nevertheless, far too little attention has been paid to the technical constraints of the network under this scenario. A major challenge to implementing P2P energy trading is that of ensuring that network constraints are not violated during the energy exchange. This paper proposes a methodology based on sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of P2P transactions on the network and to guarantee an exchange of energy that does not violate network constraints. The proposed method is tested on a typical UK low-voltage network. The results show that our method ensures that energy is exchanged between users under the P2P scheme without violating the network constraints, and that users can still capture the economic benefits of the P2P architecture.

In order to adapt the high volume of EV integration and fully decentralize the grid system, the blockchain technology is introduced to serve as an envision for the next generation grid. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain technology enabled electricity exchange market to enable EVs’ autonomy in trading energy with secured distributed energy transactions. The constructed exchange market is price competitive platform where the best bid price is modelled via the jump-diffusion process to enable users to participate in the trading process.

abstract={Since Blockchain has gained its reputation as a secure peer-to-peer trading platform, it has been the interest of new businesses and industries worldwide. In a future where every consumer is encouraged to become a producer, where everyone is encouraged to become entrepreneurs, energy Blockchain is considered to play an important role in smart grid framework. Blockchain is deemed to change all aspects of people's digital life and the way we do transactions. By eliminating the role of third parties, Blockchain can make our systems more efficient, thus reducing cost and improving reliability. Nowadays, and as a result of the development of the renewable energy sector, the energy market is shifting towards a smart de-centralization. Nevertheless, in developing countries, the development of distributed energy generation faces several economic and financial barriers. Therefore, in countries with low Distributed Energy Resources (DER), the integration of Blockchain and peer-to-peer energy trading can create an incentive for end-users to invest in DERs and the development of microgrids. When Blockchain is integrated in the power network, it can enable the tracking of energy generated by DERs, reporting of savings from ECMs, or trading CO2 credits. So the main question is: "How can the Blockchain be remodeled to serve the energy market and create opportunities for energy producers and consumers?" This paper will answer this question by providing a quick overview of the Blockchain mode of operation, highlighting the potential of the Blockchain along its integration mechanism in the energy trading business, and identifying the challenges and barriers confronting the development of the energy Blockchain. © Copyright 2018 by K and L Gates LLP.

abstract={We propose a localized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading model for locally buying and selling electricity among plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in smart grids. Unlike traditional schemes, which transport electricity over long distances and through complex electricity transportation meshes, our proposed model achieves demand response by providing incentives to discharging PHEVs to balance local electricity demand out of their own self-interests. However, since transaction security and privacy protection issues present serious challenges, we explore a promising consortium blockchain technology to improve transaction security without reliance on a trusted third party. A localized P2P Electricity Trading system with COnsortium blockchaiN (PETCON) method is proposed to illustrate detailed operations of localized P2P electricity trading. Moreover, the electricity pricing and the amount of traded electricity among PHEVs are solved by an iterative double auction mechanism to maximize social welfare in this electricity trading. Security analysis shows that our proposed PETCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real map of Texas indicate that the double auction mechanism can achieve social welfare maximization while protecting privacy of the PHEVs. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Integrative various distributed generation in energy infrastructure have brought great opportunities in recent years. However, this integration has also led to critical challenges in energy management, such as congestion pricing and non-optimality of dispatch. To address these challenges, deregulation and decentralization of electricity market is one of the effective solutions. Although various deregulation schemes have been proposed in recent years, there still remain some serious challenges in achieving resilient management of real-time energy deregulation especially in the presence of disasters. To counter this issue, in this paper, we propose a model for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactive microgrid where prosumers (Producer/Consumer) can trade local generation with each other via a smart management system. Furthermore, in our proposed model, the energy trading is executed in a decentralized manner by leveraging Blockchain technologies. Among different Blockchain technologies, we adopt the Ethereum Blockchain in our work. The auction models for energy trading are proposed by incorporating a smart contract that is the essential component of the Blockchain. In our simulations, the proposed P2P energy trading model is evaluated. © 2017 IEEE.},
